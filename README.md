# 🧅 The Wandering Peasant — *Ver. 1.03: Questpocalypse in Peasaterra*

*You are no knight. You are no hero.  
You are a muddy, mildly confused peasant.  
But the world needs someone — and unfortunately, that someone is you.*

## 🌍 About

**The Wandering Peasant** is a DnD-style terminal RPG forged in the fires of chaos and questionable decisions. Explore cursed lands, outwit tavern bards, and survive volcanic craters — all while wielding relics you barely understand.

This is peasant-core adventuring at its finest.

# Building the Game

This project uses CMake to manage the build process. Make sure you have CMake and a C++17 compatible compiler installed.

## Prerequisites

*   **CMake:** Version 3.10 or higher ([Download CMake](https://cmake.org/download/))
*   **C++ Compiler:**
    *   **Linux:** GCC or Clang (usually installed via package manager, e.g., `sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential cmake`)
    *   **macOS:** Clang (install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`) and CMake (e.g., via Homebrew: `brew install cmake`)
    *   **Windows:** Visual Studio with C++ development workload ([Download Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)) - Make sure CMake support is included or install CMake separately.

## Build Steps

### Linux / macOS (using Makefiles)

1.  **Open a terminal** in the project's root directory (where `CMakeLists.txt` is located).
2.  **Create a build directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
3.  **Configure the project with CMake:**
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```
4.  **Compile the project:**
    ```bash
    make
    ```
5.  The executable `rpg_game` will be created inside the `build` directory.

### Windows (using Visual Studio)

1.  **Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell** in the project's root directory.
2.  **Create a build directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
3.  **Configure the project with CMake (Specify Visual Studio generator):**
    *   Find your installed Visual Studio generator name by running `cmake --help` and looking at the "Generators" section (e.g., "Visual Studio 17 2022").
    *   Run CMake:
        ```bash
        # Replace "Visual Studio 17 2022" with your generator if different
        cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
        ```
4.  **Build the project:**
    *   **Option A (Using CMake):**
        ```bash
        cmake --build . --config Release
        # Or --config Debug for a debug build
        ```
        The executable `wandering_peasant.exe` will be in the `build\Release` (or `build\Debug`) subdirectory.
    *   **Option B (Using Visual Studio IDE):**
        Open the `.sln` file generated by CMake in the `build` directory with Visual Studio. Select the build configuration (e.g., Release) and build the `rpg_game` project from the IDE (usually Build > Build Solution).

## Running the Game

After building, navigate to the directory containing the executable (`build` on Linux/macOS, `build\Release` or `build\Debug` on Windows) and run it:

*   **Linux/macOS:** `./wandering_peasant`
*   **Windows:** `.\wandering_peasant.exe`
